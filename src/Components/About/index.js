            Hello! My name is Kevin Calle and I’m a computer science student at Montclair State University with a passion for web development, AI, and backend technologies. 
            I’m currently working on projects like an AI model for detecting AI-generated videos and an interactive React-based web app. 
            Through my research, I helped develop a text-to-video detector that achieves 92% accuracy. 
            Curious and solution-oriented, I approach challenges with a unique perspective. 
            Recently, I participated in a steampunk-themed hackathon and am developing a facial mood recognition app. 
            I’m excited to keep learning and exploring opportunities in software development, especially with tech leaders.
